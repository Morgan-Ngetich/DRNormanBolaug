          <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disenfectants and other applied science</li>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> - Recieves a PH.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
          <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to mexico to head a new plant Pathology program\. over the next 16years, his team breeds 6000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties of each major climate on Earth</li>
          <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
          <li><strong>1953</strong> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeilding American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertalizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
          <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to arapidly expanding population</li>

          <li><strong>1985</strong> - States "We will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only wat we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous beacause "We've been genetically modifing plants and animals for along time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
          <li><strong>2009</strong> - Dies at the age of 95</li>
        </ul>
